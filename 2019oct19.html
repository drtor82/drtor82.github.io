    <span id="starter">T</span>he comment system is up and running! A huge shout-out and thanks go to <a href="https://commentbox.io">CommentBox.io</a> for hosting the comments. They're really awesome. No ads, no tracking, and a clean interface that provides some customization even to the free comment boxes.
    <br><br>
    It took me a while to figure out anything to criticize, but I found a couple that feel more nit-picky than critical. You can't customize the color of the submit button, at least, not at the free level. So unless your website uses a green theme, it'll stand out just a hair.
    <br><br>
    The other "criticism" lies in scaling. Each comment box created with CommentBox.io acts independently of each other even though they are all under the same account, so each "professional" box is charged separately. Get enough boxes made and the other hosting companies start to look more appealing with their unlimited number of premium comment boxes. But that is something else to consider for later on. I'm happy with the service they provide me and to many others out there.
    <br><br>
    Other than that, CommentBox.io provides a very flexible interface to stylize. The background can be left transparent to provide a near-seamless look, and text colors can be altered. I really appreciate that their watermark is really subtle. When I was looking at other comment hosting services, most of them wanted to dominate your page with their content, even at the paid subscription levels.
    <br><br>
    There are a host (no pun intended) of other features that they provide, but I'm happy with what I have going right now. I may consider using them in the future. The multi-box feature will likely show up somewhere. I don't know where and how just yet, but I'm sure I will be using it sometime soon.
    <br><br>
    So now that I have a way to hear from you, please give me your thoughts and feedback. It is greatly appreciated.
