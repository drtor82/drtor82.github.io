</p><p>
    An aspiring software engineer, Don is passionate about technology and how it helps shape the future of society. Don is a perpetual student, building on his experiences and knowledged gained from just about every situation. His motto of "Adapt, modify and refine" describes his continuous search for an improved solution for any situation.
</p><p>
    Besides his hunger for knowledge and how to refine it further, Don also believes in sharing his knowledge and abilities to others. As a student he often finished his work early, but stayed late to help those who were struggling to understand. This innate drive to help others succeed was part of Don's success in the Navy earning a position in the Silver Dolphins Honor Guard in his first year in the military, becoming the Lead Petty Officer of his division onboard his submarine, and earned the promotion to 2nd Class Petty Officer less than three years after joining the service.
