                        <p>
                            I am a Navy submarine veteran who brings technical knowledge with military precision while still keeping an open mind for creative enhancements.
                        </p><p>
                            An aspiring software engineer, I am passionate about technology and how it helps shape the future of society. As a perpetual student, I continue to keep building on my experiences and knowledge gained from just about every situation. My motto of "Adapt, modify and refine" describes the continuous search for an improved solution for any situation.
                        </p><p>
                            Besides my hunger for knowledge and how to refine it further, I also believes in sharing my knowledge and abilities with others. As a student, I often finished my work early but stayed late to help those who were struggling to understand. This innate drive to help others succeed was part of my success in the Navy earning a position in the Silver Dolphins Honor Guard in my first year in the military, becoming the Lead Petty Officer of a division on board my submarine, and earned the promotion to 2nd Class Petty Officer less than three years after joining the service.
                        </p><p>
                            I am continuously looking for the next challenge to overcome. You can contact me <a href="contact.html" target="ifm">here</a>.
