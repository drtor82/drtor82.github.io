<p>Jerry looked at his ticket. His fixed income was a bit tighter than usual. He was happy to visit his grandchildren, but the short notice for a weekend babysitting also meant that the seats were sold out by the time he bought his. He didn't expect it to be a bad weekend. The grandkids were old enough to take care of themselves for the most part, and the parents would pay for the food and entertainment at the amusement park.
</p><p>	Initially, Jerry though it was too bad that their business called them away at the last minute to take care of a contract. On the other hand, however, it would guarantee the family's income for about a year, so it was actually a good thing.
</p><p>	As the arriving train was announced, a porter offered to load his bag into storage and gave Jerry a ticket to claim it later. Jerry thanked the man, clutched his cane, and climbed into the train. The train's doors closed behind him and the train began moving.
</p><p>He looked at what seemed to be the longest train car in existence and noted how full the car was. He felt a little guilty as he made his way towards the other end of the car, but he was in for a long train ride. Jerry first made eye contact with a man who was working on his laptop. The man smiled at him, but went back to typing. A few rows later, Jerry noticed a woman looking at him, but she quickly started rooting around her purse as if she never noticed him. When Jerry approached what appeared to be an empty seat, he was somewhat disappointed inside to see a teenager playing around on his smartphone. The boy stopped briefly and stared Jerry with a surprised look. He then focused on his phone with a bit more enthusiasm than normal.
</p><p>A couple of rows later, a woman motioned to Jerry. She stood up and gestured to her seat. Jerry made his way to her and smiled.
</p><p>"Are you sure, miss," Jerry asked. "My ticket doesn't have a seat on it."
</p><p>"Neither does mine," the lady said. "We're just lucky that whoever bought the seat didn't show up." She gestured to the seat again.
</p><p>"Thank you," Jerry responded. "Miss...?"
</p><p>"Melissa," she answered. "Just Melissa."
</p><p>"Ah... Melissa, thank you. I'm Jerry."
</p><p>"No worries, Jerry. I don't mind a little bit of standing."
</p><p>A couple of hours later, Jerry started to feel guilty again. He was happy that someone was willing to give up her seat to him, but he felt rested enough that he could stand for the rest of the ride.
</p><p>"I'm feeling much better, Melissa," Jerry said to her. "Would you like to sit down for a little bit? We could trade back and forth during our time."
</p><p>"Oh this is nothing," Melissa said. "There's nothing wrong with a bit of standing." She chuckled softly. "Besides, I sit too much. All day at work and at home. I insist you keep the seat."
</p><p>Jerry couldn't help, but wonder. "How much further until we get to your stop?"
</p><p>"About 3, maybe 4 more hours. I'll sit when I get there. I promise."
</p><p>Jerry felt better. She insisted that he sits there, so he thought it was probably best to honor her actions. He relaxed in his seat and a short time later he had fallen asleep.
</p><p>A couple of stops later, a new conductor had boarded the train and was verifying the passenger's tickets. Jerry sleepily reached into his pocket and presented his ticket. The conductor took a look at the ticket and noticed that it was marked no seat. He gave the ticket to Jerry who pocketed the ticket and settled back into the seat. The conductor then took Melissa's ticket. It was marked "Seat: D37". The conductor eyed the seat number above Jerry: D37. Melissa smiled and gave a shushing motion to the conductor.
</p><p>"That was very nice of you," the conductor whispered. "If you want, there is an empty seat in the next car."
</p><p>"Thanks," Melissa whispered back. "I'll take that offer. Just a moment please." She reached up and grabbed the backpack that was on the rack and settled it quietly on her back.
</p><p>The conductor sidestepped to make room for her and gestured her to move on.
</p><p>"Just one more thing," Melissa said. She reached up a little deeper onto the rack and pulled down one of her crutches. When she grabbed the other one, Melissa dropped it. The crutch rattled and bounced around on the floor causing several passengers to stare at her. She smiled as the conductor quickly bent down to pick it up and gave the crutch to her. They both looked at Jerry who was still asleep.
</p><p>"Ma'am," was all the conductor could say.
</p><p>"Thanks." She settled on her crutches and hobbled her way to the next car.
</p><p>The End
</p><p>Remember to bring comfort to others around you, even if it brings you some discomfort. You may not be able to make the whole world comfortable, but even if it is just for a little bit, you can bring comfort to someone's whole world.</p>
