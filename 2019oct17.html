            <span id="starter">W</span>elcome to the first official blog of my portfolio. It is currently in beta and will likely stay that way due to realizing new ideas and implementing them. My primary focus is limiting the number of external dependencies needed to enjoy the content.
            <br><br>
            For this blog entry, in particular, I had to dig through the whole website's coding and clean up a LOT of it. I spent much of my night creating the blog bar and debugging. It took me a minute to solve out why the blog menu would not format correctly. It turned out that the JavaScript control and an obsolete CSS code I did not notice were the causes of the issue.
            <br><br>
            After debugging, I realized how much cleaner I could make everything and spent the rest of the night sorting and clearing out redundant and obsolete codes.
            <br><br>
            Now that the website is running smoother, I can focus my attention on creating more content and improving the software that is already in place. I will still fix bugs as I find them.
            <br><br>
            Look for new content here shortly, starting with an always accessible Comment system. With that, you'll be able to leave your thoughts here, and I can use them to improve the user experience.
